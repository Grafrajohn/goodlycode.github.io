<p>Wordpress is huge. In fact it is estimated that 172,000,000 sites use it. There is a reason for this: whatever you want to do on the web, WordPress can do it. There is a range of plug-ins - many of them free - which allow you to connect with your social network base, have a friendly customer contact form, and make your blog or web site lighting fast.</p>
<p>Many of the biggest hitters on the web use WordPress. Recently some of the biggest were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>TechCrunch.</li>
    <li>The New Yorker.</li>
    <li>BBC America.</li>
    <li>Bloomberg Professional.</li>
    <li>The Official Star Wars Blog.</li>
    <li>Variety.</li>
    <li>Sony Music.</li>
    <li>MTV News.</li>
</ul>
